# Titanic Survival Prediction with Deep Learning
This repository contains a deep learning solution for the popular titanic dataset, predicting whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster. The model is built using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras,

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/). It consists of the training data 'train.csv' with labelled examples and the test data 'test.csv'.

The model is trained using early stopping to avoid overfitting. Feature engineering was also implemented. The predictions for the test set are saved in the 'submission.csv' file. This model had an accuracy of 0.75119 on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/leaderboard)
